## Getting here

**Rent a car** from the airport. We like to say everything in and around Indianapolis is ~20 mins away from each other. The venue is a 20-30 min drive from Indianapolis Downtown. If you chose to stay somewhere in Brownsburg, Whitestown or Avon, it will be a 10-15 min drive.

<!-- ## Gifts -->
